                        <p className='mt-11 text-white text-base font-normal font-raleway italic max-w-[515px]'>Remember (3,3) at its core was about social coordination. Or, people working together to achieve a common outcome or goal. (E,E) is the same. But with (E,E) people are working together not to grow a robust treasury that would back a decentralized stablecoin but instead to establish the first ever decentralized amplified yield token… $EEFI. A token that can produce yield in any market condition.</p>
                        <p className='mt-5 text-white text-base font-normal font-raleway italic max-w-[502px]'>To achieve this (E,E) has everyone work together by interacting with and supporting its ecosystem flywheel: Vaults, Bonds, Markets and other components. Interaction with the (E,E) Flywheel will help build a treasury of what we term high quality “growth assets”. Assets that are revenue bearing, interest bearing, Real Yield bearing or Rebase bearing. Where the ‘growth’ aka the yields of these assets are used to act as long term decentralized leverage on EEFI’s value. This is (E,E). This is sustainable. This is the UPGRADE.</p>
